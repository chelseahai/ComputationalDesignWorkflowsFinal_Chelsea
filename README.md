## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Modern web browser with JavaScript enabled
- Internet connection (for external libraries)

### Installation
1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser
3. Navigate through the different sections using the menu

### Local Development
To run this locally, you can use any simple HTTP server:

```bash
# Using Python 3
python -m http.server 8000

# Using Node.js (if you have http-server installed)
npx http-server

# Using PHP
php -S localhost:8000
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.
